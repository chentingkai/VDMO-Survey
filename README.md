This project involves pretty outstanding and typical works with respect to underwater image enhancement and detection, which consists of model-based restoration, model-free enhancement, data-driven image-to-image conversion, one- and two-stage detectors.

In addition, both the underwater image enhancement and detection datasets have been provided.
